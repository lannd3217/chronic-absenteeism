# Chronic Absenteeism Data Exploration and Prediction
## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting chronic absenteeism among students in various schools. The dataset comprises student records from multiple school years, including key demographic, attendance, and academic performance. The goal is to identify patterns and factors contribituting to chronic absenteeism and build predictive models for early intervention.
The project is divided into two main phases:
1. Data Exploration: Cleaning, transforming, and visualizing student data to understand trends and missing data patterns.
2. Prediction Models: Using machine learning techniques to forecast chronic absenteeism for the upcominh school year, leveraging past attendance, demographic, and academic performance data.
